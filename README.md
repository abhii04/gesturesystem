# gesture based control system
-I made a gesture-based control system which basically uses camera from your device to recognize gestures from your hand and feed it to Arduino which changes the environment (In this case a LED strip) 

-I used python and Arduino IDE to make this work.

-Using pycharm I wrote a code which uses open cv and mediapipe to detect hand gestures (I coded them to be thumbs up and thumbs down)

-The thumbs up gesture results in the led strip turning green and the thumbs down gesture turns the led strip red.
